It was sunny from Monday to Friday
Summer is calling, but I have work to do
I couldn’t answer summer’s passion
but stuck in the office room

Finally Friday night has arrived
I opened the weather app
85% chance of rain, it said
on the upcoming Saturday

It’s not the only time this has happened -
but 14 straight weeks this year,
already!

Nature, did you make a deal with capitalism
so that when we can finally rest, you begin to cry?
why can’t we enjoy the tiny bit of life we have?

it’s not that I don’t like rain
It always makes me peaceful and rested
but Summer called me so many times during the week
and this is the day I can finally answer.

But summer is gone, all of a sudden - 
maybe because I ignored its call too often

Maybe it’s not the fault of Nature.
Nature doesn’t have Saturdays, after all
I wish there will come a day
when we can all answer summer’s call - 
when it rings.
